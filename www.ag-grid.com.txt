This is a list of all the events that the grid raises.
You register callbacks for these events through the GridOptions interface.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
TypeScript users can take advantage of the events' interfaces. You can construct the interface name by suffixing the event name with Event. For example, the cellClicked event uses the interface CellClickedEvent. All events support generics. See Typescript Generics for more details.
Registering the event onto the grid component as shown above is the recommended way. However additionally a callback can be put on the Grid Options, if you are using a Grid Options object.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
The following are all events emitted by the grid. If using TypeScript, you can reference the interface for each event.

Mailing ListCommunity or Enterprise?Everyone can use AG Grid Community for free.

A license is only required when you start developing for production.JavaScript Data GridGrid EventsThis is a list of all the events that the grid raises.You register callbacks for these events through the GridOptions interface.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
const gridOptions = {
     // Add event handlers
     onCellClicked: (event: CellClickedEvent) => console.log('Cell was clicked'),
 }

TypeScript users can take advantage of the events' interfaces. You can construct the interface name by suffixing the event name with Event. For example, the cellClicked event uses the interface CellClickedEvent. All events support generics. See Typescript Generics for more details.
Registering via Grid OptionsRegistering the event onto the grid component as shown above is the recommended way. However additionally a callback can be put on the Grid Options, if you are using a Grid Options object.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
const gridOptions = {
     // Add event handlers
     onCellClicked: (event: CellClickedEvent) => console.log('Cell was clicked'),
 }

The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
const gridOptions = {
     // Add event handlers
     onCellClicked: (event: CellClickedEvent) => console.log('Cell was clicked'),
 }

TypeScript users can take advantage of the events' interfaces. You can construct the interface name by suffixing the event name with Event. For example, the cellClicked event uses the interface CellClickedEvent. All events support generics. See Typescript Generics for more details.
Registering via Grid OptionsRegistering the event onto the grid component as shown above is the recommended way. However additionally a callback can be put on the Grid Options, if you are using a Grid Options object.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
const gridOptions = {
     // Add event handlers
     onCellClicked: (event: CellClickedEvent) => console.log('Cell was clicked'),
 }

JavaScript Data GridGrid EventsThis is a list of all the events that the grid raises.You register callbacks for these events through the GridOptions interface.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
const gridOptions = {
     // Add event handlers
     onCellClicked: (event: CellClickedEvent) => console.log('Cell was clicked'),
 }

TypeScript users can take advantage of the events' interfaces. You can construct the interface name by suffixing the event name with Event. For example, the cellClicked event uses the interface CellClickedEvent. All events support generics. See Typescript Generics for more details.
Registering via Grid OptionsRegistering the event onto the grid component as shown above is the recommended way. However additionally a callback can be put on the Grid Options, if you are using a Grid Options object.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
const gridOptions = {
     // Add event handlers
     onCellClicked: (event: CellClickedEvent) => console.log('Cell was clicked'),
 }
List of EventsThe following are all events emitted by the grid. If using TypeScript, you can reference the interface for each event.AccessoriestoolPanelVisibleChangedTypeToolPanelVisibleChangedEvent The tool panel visibility has changed.

This is a list of all the events that the grid raises.You register callbacks for these events through the GridOptions interface.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
const gridOptions = {
     // Add event handlers
     onCellClicked: (event: CellClickedEvent) => console.log('Cell was clicked'),
 }

TypeScript users can take advantage of the events' interfaces. You can construct the interface name by suffixing the event name with Event. For example, the cellClicked event uses the interface CellClickedEvent. All events support generics. See Typescript Generics for more details.
Registering via Grid OptionsRegistering the event onto the grid component as shown above is the recommended way. However additionally a callback can be put on the Grid Options, if you are using a Grid Options object.
The name of the callback is constructed by prefixing the event name with on. For example, the callback for the cellClicked event is gridOptions.onCellClicked.
